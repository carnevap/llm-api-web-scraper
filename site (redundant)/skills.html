Alright so hello and welcome to my research project. My task is to build 
a python program that will give coding examples that the user will have 
to complete and give suggestions as to where the user went wrong if they 
make a mistake. The questions will be gathered from other online sources 
using a crawler. It will use machine learning to search for, find and grab 
questions from existing programming sites.

Then step 2 is to classify those programming questions into categories 
and remove duplicates.

Then utilize some open-source large language models to assist with 
code generation and completion.

Steps:

**Step 1: Web Scraping and Question Collection**

I need to create a web crawler that scrapes programming questions from 
online sources. Python libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` 
can help with web scraping. The specific steps include:

1. Identify online sources (e.g., Stack Overflow, GitHub, Codecademy) 
to scrape questions from.
2. Write a web crawler that can visit these websites, extract questions, 
and relevant code snippets.
3. Store the questions and code snippets in a structured format (e.g., 
JSON, CSV, or a database).

**Step 2: Question Classification and Deduplication**

After collecting questions, I need to classify them into categories 
and remove duplicates. Here are the steps:

1. Define a set of categories or tags that questions can belong to (e.g., 
Python, JavaScript, Machine Learning).
2. Implement a classification system that assigns each question to one 
or more categories based on keywords or other criteria.
3. Remove duplicate questions to ensure the uniqueness of your dataset.

**Step 3: Code Generation and Completion**

I'll need to integrate a large language model like GPT-3 (or GPT-4 if 
it's available) for code generation and completion. This step involves:

1. Set up an API connection to the language model service (e.g., OpenAI's 
GPT-3).
2. Create a function or module that takes a partial code snippet as input 
and generates code completions.
3. When a user attempts to complete a coding example, send their input 
to the language model and receive suggestions or completions.
4. Process and present the suggestions to the user, highlighting potential 
issues or mistakes.

**Step 4: User Interface**

Develop a user interface to make it user-friendly. I can build a web 
application, a desktop application, or a command-line interface (CLI) to 
interact with the program. This UI should allow users to:

1. Choose a category or topic for the coding example they want to work on.
2. Provide partial code snippets.
3. Receive suggestions for code completion and error correction.
4. See explanations or hints for mistakes if they make errors.

**Step 5: Testing and Improvement**

Test my program thoroughly to ensure it works as expected and provides 
valuable suggestions. Collect user feedback and continuously improve the 
system based on the feedback and usage data.

**Step 6: Deployment**

Once my program is working well, you can deploy it to a server or make it 
available for users to access.
