<h1><b>Let me introduce myself:</b></h1>
Hello there! My name is Patrick Carnevale, and I'm thrilled to welcome 
you to my world. I'm a passionate and ambitious 4th-year Computer Science 
student, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my 
knowledge and skills.

Ever since I can remember, I've been captivated by the marvels of technology 
and its ability to shape the world we live in. This fascination led me on 
a journey to pursue a degree in Computer Science, where I have delved into 
the realms of programming, algorithms, artificial intelligence, and so much 
more. The field never fails to amaze me with its endless potential and the 
way it empowers us to solve complex problems and improve lives.

During my academic journey, I've had the privilege of working on various 
exciting projects, Which you can browse in the "Projects" tab of this website. 
These experiences have not only honed my technical expertise but also fostered 
my creativity and problem-solving skills.

Beyond the realm of computer science, I have a diverse range of interests. 
I'm an avid reader, finding comfort / escape in the pages of both fiction 
and non-fiction books. I aslo love the world of video games and media. 
Exploring different cultures and cuisines also brings me immense joy, and 
I love to travel whenever I get the chance. Additionally, I enjoy staying 
somewhat active, whether it's through hiking, taking walks, or doing exercise.

As a firm believer in the power of collaboration, I'm always eager to connect 
with like-minded individuals and professionals from various backgrounds. I 
thrive in team environments, cherishing the opportunity to share ideas, 
learn from others, and contribute my unique perspective.

Looking ahead, I am excited to continue my journey in the world of computer 
science and technology. My goal is not only to excel academically but also 
to make a meaningful impact in the industry, using my skills to build 
innovative solutions that positively impact people's lives.

Thank you for visiting my profile. Together, let's embrace the boundless 
possibilities that the world of Computer Science has to offer!
